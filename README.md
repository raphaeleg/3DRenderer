![Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/342927bd-eec2-4c0f-8564-c1dab8aa2745)

This is a very basic 3D Renderer that serves as a quick OpenGL overview.
- Loads any Model or Scene, including a defined material.
- Basic Camera Movement Inputs (Movement and Rotation).
- Point light attached to the Camera
- Loads a GLSL vertex and fragment shader file.
